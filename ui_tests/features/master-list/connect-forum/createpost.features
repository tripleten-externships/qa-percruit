Feature: Percuit Website Student-Connect-Forums- Create a New post
@wip
Scenario: When I add the title "Student cancels post creation" to the log 
 Given the student is on the "Create a New Topic" page
 When the student enters a valid title
 And clicks the "Cancel" button
 Then the user should be redirected back to the “Forums” page
  And no new post should be created
