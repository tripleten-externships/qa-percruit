Feature: Average Response Time Display
  As an admin user
  I want to see the average response time on the dashboard
  So that I can monitor system performance

    Background:
      Given the user is logged in as an admin
      And the Admin Dashboard is displayed
      And the System Health Monitor card is visible

    @smoke @positive
    Scenario: Average response time is displayed in milliseconds
      Given the system has a response time value
      Then the Avg Response Time metric is visible
      And the response time is displayed in milliseconds
      And the response time value includes the "ms" unit

    @positive
    Scenario: Average response time displays as a numeric value
      Given the system has a response time value
      Then the Avg Response Time metric is visible
      And the response time is displayed as a numeric value
      And the numeric value is followed by "ms" unit
