## âœ¨ Quickstart: The Easy Way (GitHub Codespaces)

This is the fastest and most reliable way to get started.

1.  **Open in Codespaces:** Click the green **`< > Code`** button, go to the **Codespaces** tab, and click **"Create codespace on main"**.
2.  **Wait for Setup:** The container will build automatically. This might take a few minutes the first time.
3.  **Run the Tests!** Once the VS Code editor loads, open a new terminal (`Ctrl` + `~`) and run the sample tests to confirm everything works:
    * **To run UI tests:**
        ```bash
        cd ui_tests
        npm test
        ```
    * **To run API tests:**
        ```bash
        cd api_tests
        poetry run pytest
        ```
